My portfolio is now made with Vite! In my last version, I learned how to use Tailwind, but I was using the CDN, which makes loading times slower. I'm using Vite to build the project this time, which allows me to make the site fast, and Tailwind will only load the style it needs.

Here is the [old version](https://github.com/3kh0/portfolio-v2) if you want to see how bad it was.

## Features

- Fast loading times.
- Responsive, to an extent.
- Made with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
- Styles by [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).
