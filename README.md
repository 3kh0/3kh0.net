### Now with Vue!

![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/3kh0/3kh0.net/testbuild.yml?label=Build)

My portfolio is now made with Vue! In my last version, I learned how to use Tailwind, but I was using the CDN, which makes loading times slower. I'm using Vite to build the project this time, which allows me to make the site fast, and Tailwind will only load the style it needs.

## Features

- Fast loading times.
- Responsive, to an extent.
- Made with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/).
- Styles by [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/3kh0/3kh0.net.git
```
2. Install dependencies, then build and start the project: 
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
